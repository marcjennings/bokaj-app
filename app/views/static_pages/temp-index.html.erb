1. rails generate migration add_event_date_to_products
2. Then inside the migraiton file we added the ActiveRecord Migraiton command:
     add_column :products, :event_date, :datetime

     http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html
3. We did : rake db:migrate
    which actually executed the migration

4. Then we had to update the edit form in order to be able to accept the new field/property. So we amended the products/_form.html.erb

5. Then we white listed the :event_date attribute inside the products_controller. Look at method "product_params"

6. Then inside the static_pages/index.html.erb we made sure to display the event date of each product using strftime for formatting.

/products/new  ....admin to add new products
/products/<product_id>/edit ....admin to update product details
/products ... admin to get the list of product and pick one to manage (update/destroy)

/ ..... is designed to display all the products in order for your visitor to pick one
/products/<product_id> its for your visitor to see the details of the product and purchase it.

/views/products/show.html.erb is the view code for "/products/<product_id>" and this is the page you need to design for the product to be displayed and user to purchase.
this view is being prepared and served by products_controller action show.
